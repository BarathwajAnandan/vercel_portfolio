## Overview

LeetCode Complexity Analyzer is a Chrome extension that automatically analyzes the time and space complexity of your LeetCode and NeetCode solutions. This tool helps developers understand algorithm efficiency, optimize their code, and prepare more effectively for technical interviews.

## Key Features

- **Instant, Real-Time Analysis:** Automatically determines the time and space complexity of your code as you work on problems.
- **Seamless Integration:** Adds an "Analyze Code" button near the Submit button on LeetCode and NeetCode interfaces.
- **Educational Explanations:** Provides clear, concise explanations alongside complexity analysis to deepen understanding.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Works with all programming languages supported by LeetCode and NeetCode.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean design that integrates naturally with the LeetCode and NeetCode environments.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Core extension functionality
- **Chrome Extension API:** Browser integration
- **Algorithm Analysis Techniques:** Pattern recognition for complexity determination
- **HTML/CSS:** UI components and styling
- **RegEx:** Code parsing and analysis

## How It Works

The extension employs sophisticated pattern recognition to analyze code structure, identifying common algorithmic patterns and their associated complexities. It examines:

1. **Loop Structures:** Detects nested loops, recursion, and iteration patterns
2. **Data Structure Usage:** Identifies efficiency implications of arrays, hash tables, trees, etc.
3. **Algorithm Patterns:** Recognizes common approaches like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc.

After analysis, it presents the results directly in the LeetCode interface, showing both the Big O notation and an explanation of the reasoning behind the assessment.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing this extension presented several interesting challenges:

- **Accurate Complexity Detection:** Creating reliable heuristics to analyze diverse coding styles and approaches
- **Language-Agnostic Analysis:** Building a system that works across multiple programming languages
- **UI Integration:** Seamlessly incorporating the extension into the existing LeetCode interface
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring the extension itself doesn't impact the user's coding experience

## Outcome

LeetCode Complexity Analyzer has become an essential tool for developers preparing for technical interviews or seeking to deepen their understanding of algorithm efficiency. By providing immediate feedback on code complexity, it helps users:

- Develop a stronger intuition for algorithm performance
- Identify optimization opportunities in their solutions
- Better prepare for the types of efficiency discussions common in technical interviews
- Learn through practice rather than just theory

The extension serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource, making algorithm complexity analysis more accessible to developers at all skill levels.
