2019. A year etched in my memory, not for triumphs celebrated, but for the profound loss and the monumental decision that followed. It was the year my world turned upside down, the year I lost my father, and the year I chose to leap into the unknown.

## The Unimaginable Loss

The year began like any other, but it soon took a devastating turn. My father, my guiding star, my hero, passed away. The grief was overwhelming, a tidal wave that threatened to consume everything. He had always been my biggest champion, the one who taught me to reach for the stars, even when they felt impossibly far away. He worked tirelessly to provide for our family, always putting our needs before his own. His sacrifices, his unwavering belief in me, even when I had nothing, fueled my ambition. In the midst of this personal tragedy, a beacon of hope appeared: an acceptance letter from Carnegie Mellon University.

## A Crossroads of Grief and Opportunity

The CMU admit was a dream come true, the culmination of years of hard work, a dream my father had shared with me. But it came at the worst possible time. It presented me with an agonizing choice: stay in my hometown with my grieving mother, or pursue this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, which meant taking out a daunting $100,000 loan. Leaving my mother alone, especially when she had just lost her life partner, felt unbearable. The weight of the decision pressed down on me, a crushing burden during an already unbearable time. I knew how much this opportunity meant, not just to me, but to my father, who had always wanted to give me the world.

## My Mother's Strength

It was my mother, the strongest woman I know, who ultimately tipped the scales. Still reeling from the loss of my father, she recognized the magnitude of this opportunity. She wasn't ready to face the world without him, yet she selflessly encouraged me to take the leap. She would support me, she said, with everything she had. Her strength, her unwavering belief in me, gave me the courage to choose the path that terrified me. She reminded me of Dad's dreams for me, and how proud he would be.

## Taking the Leap of Faith

Leaving behind everything familiar, I embarked on a journey fueled by grief, determination, and my parents' love. It was a leap of faith, a commitment to making the most of the opportunity that had presented itself amidst the chaos. It was a decision to honor my father's memory and to make my mother proud, to fulfill the dreams they both had for me.

## More Than a Milestone

This wasn't just about a career move; it was about survival, resilience, and the profound bond between parents and child. It was about honoring the sacrifices my parents had made for me, especially my father's relentless drive to provide me with opportunities he never had. It marked the beginning of a new chapter, one where I would strive to live up to the potential they saw in me, even when I doubted myself. I wanted to make my dad proud, to show him that his sacrifices were not in vain.

## Gratitude

My mother's unwavering support during this tumultuous time was my lifeline. Her strength and selflessness, coupled with the memory of my father's enduring love and sacrifices, continue to inspire me every day. I am eternally grateful for their love and belief in me.

## Looking Ahead

2019 was a turning point. It was the year I faced unimaginable loss and made a decision that would forever alter the course of my life. It was the year I decided to make my mom and dad proud. While the pain of loss remains, it is intertwined with a fierce determination to build a future worthy of their sacrifices, and to continue on this journey, knowing that I carry their love with me, always. I know my dad is watching over me, and I hope to make him proud one day.
